title: Quit Your Job, Don't Quit Money
subtitle: Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. - Mark Twain

We made Fight The Cube to empower employees wanting a better life to break free of the corporate lifestyle with weapons of financial independence. 

All our lives weâ€™ve been brainwashed on what it means to have the perfect life. Go to college, get a stable job, have two kids, stuff an overpriced Audi into your driveway (Lexus if you can afford.)

But somehow that life leads to more debt, more time working in a cubicle, and less time saving and exploring the wonders of the planet with the people you cherish.

We are warriors on this journey with you, we are deep in the jungle of hustle, we are deep in the laboratory of our own manhattan project to discover the secrets of early retirement.

We are building an arsenal of passive income weapons to fight against the dogma of society. And it is the craft of honing the knife that we want to share with the world.

We hope you'll join us and follow along as we field test everything on the site in our own lives.
