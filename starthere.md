title: Quit Your Job But Don't Quit Money
subtitle: Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect. - Mark Twain

We made Fight The Cube to empower employees wanting a better life to break free of the corporate lifestyle with weapons of financial independence. 

Because life is too unique and our time experiencing life too short to minimize the Game of Thrones window when the boss walks by.

We want to watch Game of Thrones whenever we want dammit.

Furthermore we want to swim with dolphins, climb seqoia trees, sled down a volcano, surf on slow rolling waves, teach our kids, cook with our family, build shelter for the homeless, go to minor league baseball games whenever we want to as well.

We as a country are swimming in a cesspool of over $929 billion dollars in total revolving debt.  A college degree once a sure marker of success (so my parents say) is now almost entirely irrelevant in the job market (I don’t even have mine on my resume.) And even if you do get one of these coveted jobs they are unlikely to give you any sort of raise without the threat of you leaving.

The rules have changed, and too prosper we too have to change with them.

All our lives we’ve been brainwashed on what it means to have the perfect life. Go to college, get a stable job, have two kids, stuff an overpriced Audi into your driveway (Lexus if you can afford.)

But somehow that life leads to more debt, more time working in a cubicle, and less time saving and exploring the wonders of the planet with the people you cherish.

Let’s talk about time, not that 'time' I'm talking about Time with a capital 'T', being the amount of finite time each one of us has left on the planet.

A battleground fought in the valley of Time is emerging. One between us and the people who chain us to our desks. The spoils of this war are HUGE and a fruitfull life of less material goods, more freedom, and more profit is through the looking glass. But how do we get there?

That's where we come in. We are warriors on this journey with you, we are deep in the jungle of personal finance, we are deep in the laboratory of our own manhattan project (this one with less destruction) to discover the weapons of peronal finance.

We are building an arsenal of these weapons to fight against the dogma of society. And it is the craft of honing the proverbial knife that we want to share with the world.

Welcome To The Fight.
