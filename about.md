## Adam Weitzman:

Hi I'm Adam, I'm a Software Developer in Austin, TX. 

Ever since I read the book [Farewell My Subaru](http://dougfine.com/books/farewell-my-subaru/) in high school I've been totally obsessed with nature.

This lead me to take a job as a Naturalist out of college (a profession where you take people on hikes.)

As you can imagine I wasn't making billions and quickly fell into debt, and after 3 years of backbreaking 14 hour days I had almost nothing to show for it.

So I went on a journey to make more of the $$ and ended up programming for the last 3 years. And while I'm making a decent wage, I'm chained to my desk from 9 - 5 most days of the year.

It seems it's either make money and suffer, or do something awesome and make no money. I want to have both.

Enter Fight The Cube where we interview people who have both money, and the time to do things they are passionate about.

## Noah Weitzman:

Hi Iâ€™m Noah, Sales slave in Austin, TX. 

Actually, I used to be a geologist working in the Oil & Gas industry. 

One day, my birthday in fact. I was sent on a 18 hour workday voyage across West Texas doing manual labor tasks in August. 

I got to my last task. It was 110 degrees, I was in a flame retardant suit made of extremely thick denim covering my whole body. I proceeded to drill five six foot holes manually through cement like soil.

That night (still my birthday) I got back to my hotel room at 10:00, too tired to call anyone I lay in bed and thought. 

I vowed never to let that happen to myself again. To figure out the whole income thing so I could take back control of my life. 

My journey had begun.
