# Why?



1) We made this podcast to learn how to save, profit, and hustle our way out of the 9 - 5 machine.

2) We want others to find value in our struggle ... learn from our mistakes, build off our successes, drink black coffee.

3) Join us as we battle the demons of corporate zombie existence and fight our way into the light of financial independence...that or we go down in flames trying :)
