# Why?



* We made this podcast to learn how to save, profit, and hustle our way out of the 9 - 5 machine.

* We want others to find value in our struggle ... learn from our mistakes, build off our successes, drink black coffee.

* Join us as we battle the demons of corporate zombie existence and fight our way into the light of financial independence...that or we go down in flames trying :)
