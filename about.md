## Adam Weitzman:

Hi I'm Adam, I'm a Software Developer in Austin TX. 

Ever since I read the book [Farewell My Subaru](http://dougfine.com/books/farewell-my-subaru/) and lived in the Oregon desert during high school I've been totally obsessed with nature.

This lead me to take a job as a Naturalist out of college (a profession where you take people on hikes.)

As you can imagine I wasn't making billions and quickly fell into debt, and after 3 years of backbreaking 14 hour days I had almost nothing to show for it.

So I went on a journey to make more of the $$ and ended up programming for the last 3 years. And while I'm making more then I ever have, I'm chained to my desk from 9 - 5 most days of the year.

It seems it's either make money. Or do something awesome and make no money. I want to have both.

Enter Fight The Cube where we interview people who have both money, and the time to do things they are passionate about.
