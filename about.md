# Why?

* We made Fight The Cube because we hate the corporate zombie bullshit lifestyle
 

* Because we don't want to be like Bill, Bill who brings in chocolate donuts once a month to sway the execs into giving him a corner office


* Because music, writing, photography, scuba diving, surfing, shed building, chicken raising, goat herding, cocktail mixing, reading, sleeping, and buying a duvee are all more interesting then working for Bill
