<h1>Why Real Estate? Answers to the 4 most common objections</h1>

Your crazy!! I would never do that!! Don't you know that there is going to be a market crash now just like 2007, I saw it on the news last night! But you know, I dont want to get into that much debt, I am trying to pay it all off after all! 

I bought a house without ever seeing it. I bought a house without even stepping foot in the neighborhood. I bought a house without ever stepping foot in the state. 

And guess what....

I hear the above alot. Mostly the first two. Sorry did I say a lot? I mean everytime I tell someone or they have heard that I did it. 

So why did I do it and also convince my girlfriend to do it as well? 

Lets start at the top....

Unless you are a business / psychological prodigy that spends 90 hours a week consuming financial news with the latest softwate AKA Warren Buffet. Investing in individual stoacks will [lose you money](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2014/11/04/why-i-put-my-last-100000-into-betterment/)!

## But Mutual Funds?

Yes, mutual funds are great and have their place in anyones portfolio. With the rise of the robo-adviser - [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) Or [Wealthfront](https://www.wealthfront.com/?gclid=CJ-j8rim9NMCFQctaQod6qoJYA) it has never been easier to invest your money effectively with no effort. 

But guess what.... You will average a 7% return. 

Hold up Noah! I have been getting 20% the last couple of years. Don't you slander me!  

Yes, the last couple of years have been great but the stock market averages out to a [7% return year over year](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/).

There is nothing wrong with 7% a year! With that much you can become rich in....
 
 20 years? 30 years? 

 I can't work for 30 more years! I must experience the joy of freedom now! 30 years! 

 I give up, I'm moving to Tahiti to be a bartender. 
 Ya thats right, you did just think of [cocktail](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094889/) the best Tom Cruise movie. 

But wait.... 

## With real estate I am calculated to make around 30% when I sell my property in 5 years!

Hold up!....How do you know that?

Below is a quick overview of the income from my rental property.

What are all the numbers and which one do I need to look at? 

Well my friends that will be covered in another blog post but for now let me direct your attention to the "Return on Cash Invested at the top," since we are comparing this to stocks lets use this. Remember on average the US stock market will give you a 7% return on your investment in stocks. 

## I invested $18,400 in my home, lets see how this stacks up if I put it into the stock market:

STOCKS: Invested $18,400 in stocks and sold after 5 years, made a 7% annual return. 

With compound interest your total in 5 years = $25,807
gross profit = $25,807 - $18,400 = $7,407

REAL ESTATE: Invested $18,400 in a house and sold after 5 years, using my actuall conservative assumptions for expenses, insurance, taxes, vacancy, prop management, and appreciation:

Total after selling = $45,850 
gross profit = $45,850 - $18,400 = $27,450

## $7,047 Versus $27,450, you be the judge. 

Yes, Yes, Yes, there are many different factors that go into both this is an oversimplification but even with extremely conservative estimates on the real estate side you made 4 times the income. 

## Want to see what happens if we double down on both! O boy, more math, but enlightenment awaits! 

I reinvest the $25,807 I made back into stocks for another five years. 

Total income = $36,196
gross profit = $36,196 - $18,400 = $17,796 Sad Panda! 

I reinvest my $45,850 into real estate and put 20% down on a $220,925 home like a boss! Using the same rations for my previous property:

Total income = $114,166 income
Final gross profit = $114,166 - $18,400 = $95,766

## $95,766 versus $17,796

You be the judge
