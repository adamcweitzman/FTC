<h1>5 Questions To Discover Your Hidden Money Myths</h1>

Whether your parents told you that money was a reincarnation of satan or that money was the salvation to all the world’s problems your money education was hardened into your synapses from a young age.

But are you telling yourself the right things?

I wasn't. 

## Question 1: Is Money Evil?

 * Do I think money corrupts and only produces wars and financial fraudsters like [Bernie Madoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Madoff)?

 * Was I brought up to believe that money should be avoided? or nurtured?

### My Money Myth

My parents would rather have seen me reading Plato then reading [Rich Dad Poor Dad](http://www.richdad.com/).

### What's Wrong With This Myth?

This myth assumes that there aren't regular average joe millionaires. In truth there are [10.8 Million Millionaires](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/a-record-number-of-americans-are-now-millionaires-new-study-shows.html) nationwide.

So we are a country of millionaires!

If we make talking about money a taboo, then guess what happens? We have a school system that never teaches about money and students that graduate 40 - 50K in debt with only rudimentary financial literacy to properly handle those loans.

But what about greed! surely greed is bad! [Greed is good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVxYOQS6ggk)!

Greediness is a lack of this financial education. Greediness is a lack of understanding just how much money one needs to not only survive [but to prosper](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/).

## Question 2: When Someone Says "Investing" What Do I Think About?

* If I found a pot of money sitting at the end of a leprechaun rainbow how would I invest it?

### My Money Myth

I can't help myself, when I hear the word "Investing" I think of Stratton Oakmont and that line from Boiler Room: 

"I don't have a wicked jump shot, I used to slang crack rock. I need a job."

### What's Wrong With This Myth?

My family played the stock market and danced in and out during the crash of the late 2000's. Despite there being oodles of evidence that [Simply Dumping Money in Index Funds](http://jlcollinsnh.com/2013/02/05/stocks-part-xv-index-funds-are-really-just-for-lazy-people-right/) will earn you an 8% return on average and beat out 90% of the market. 

My aunts and uncles still believe that stock investing is how my grandfather became wealthy, when in truth he invested in real estate when land in the southwest was cheap cheap cheap.

Stock market trading without a bakery of experience cookies is [similar to gambling](https://www.quora.com/Is-intraday-equity-trading-complete-gambling) and even regular traders can find the [market difficult to predict](http://jlcollinsnh.com/2012/04/25/stocks-part-iii-most-people-lose-money-in-the-market/).

Everyone should invest. Investing smart and strong is how we get out of #cubelyfe.

The more knowledge you have in investing, the better off you are, so if you are going to day trade do your due diligence and look at [some alternatives](/2017-05-07-Passively-Earn-60K-A-Year-With-Airbnb/). 

Most of all invest in yourself, WTF does that mean? 

Invest in new skills, in businesses, in ideas that are swimming around your brain pool waiting to spawn. Investing in yourself also means saving more for yourself and not buying the Trident gum every time you are in the checkout line.

## Question 3: When I Look At A Credit Card Do I See Debt? Or Opportunity?

* Do I have a list of credit cards I want to get?

* Should I be maxing out my credit? Will it hurt my score?

I got my first credit card when I was in college and had terrible credit which lead to some broke ass housing.

I thought that a credit card was to be used as a last resort, so only stuck to debit.

### What's Wrong With This Myth?

Lots has been written about the [panty dropping joy of having good credit](https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/importance-credit-take-advantage/) so I won’t hash that out here.

But the miles, so many miles, miles for the rest of your life even?

The myth of credit cards hurting your score is folly, yes the average age of credit goes down with each card you get and it may dip a little in the short term.

However, in the long term if you have [positive utilization](https://www.thebalance.com/how-opening-a-new-credit-card-affects-your-credit-score-960501) your score will shoot up.

I've flown free for a year now and I can't go back, you can't make me United Airlines, no matter how many people you punch.

## Question 4: Do I Think A Matching 401K Is The Best Retirement Plan?

* The company match is free money, why not use it?

Usually when you start at a company they will auto-enroll you for the 401k in Fidelity or some other such establishment of suited men walking briskly drinking shitty office coffee carrying briefcases. That kind of vibe.

I was enrolled in Fidelity 401K at my last job, when I quit and went to cash out I was told that I owned none of the matching part of the 401K.

"It takes a year to vest 25% of the match."

### What's Wrong With This Myth?

Since the average stay for millennials in a job is a [a few years](http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/job-hopping-years-new-normal-millennials-article-1.2773393) most will not receive part if not all of their match.

Make sure to read the fine print when you opt for the match, no one will tell you how long it takes for the match to vest, don't get screwed like me. Stupid stupid me.

If you want to avoid the vesting, not be dependent on an employer to hold your money, and avoid taxes on withdrawals check out the [Roth IRA](/2017-04-16-Is-Your-401K-A-Goldmine-Or-A-Money-Pit) which you can possibly max out right now with a $5,500 contribution.

Also with a Roth you can take your contributions out any time tax free, so it is liquid money! with a 401k those contributions are subject to tax on withdrawal.

Or you can be super legit and [buy gold](/is-it-worthwhile-to-invest-in-precious-metals) for your retirement plan.

## Question 5: Can I retire with a million dollars?

* How can I make more faster?

Chasing the salary dragon and bringing your expensive lifestyle with you will not speed up any kind of retirement.

My parents are into their senior years and both are still working making about 3x the average wage.

### What's Wrong With This Myth?

How much do you need exactly to retire?

If you were to go back in time and calculate the amount of money you made up until this point in your life what would the number be? Would it be over the amount you spend in a year?

How about if you had saved all that money?

If you're not familiar with the 4% rule (amount of money you need to retire) here's the best rundown of making [25x what you need to survive indefinitely](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/05/29/how-much-do-i-need-for-retirement/).

If you don't know the actual number you need to retire, stop what you are doing and [calculate it now](https://www.nerdwallet.com/investing/retirement-calculator)!

Don't chase the salary dragon into the grave, beware the seemingly benign new dress, car, house, country club membership. Save enough to invest, if you max out your Roth each year in 35 years you will be a millionaire. [Don't believe me?](http://www.ourfreakingbudget.com/why-we-max-out-our-roth-ira/)

## Action Items

* Write down 5 things your parents taught you about money
* Write next to each thing if what they taught you has helped you financially
* Calculate exactly how much money you need to retire
* Write up a cost benefit list of using a RothIRA vs 401K

This can be an emotional experience to tally up all your expenses. But can produce crystal clear financial awareness.

Whenever you discover something icky in your finances remember it's not about blaming yourself. It's about moving forward with the right strategy, and a stronger plan for freedom.

I hope you take these steps to make great changes in your wallet and your life.
